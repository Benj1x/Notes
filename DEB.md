# Design and Evaluation of User Interfaces

## Envisionment

Envisionment is concerned with making ideas visible; with 
externalizing thoughts. Externalization can take all manner of forms: 
stories and scenarios, presentations, sketches, formal models, software 
prototypes, cardboard models and so on. Different forms of 
representation will be more or less useful at different stages in the 
design process and more or less effective for doing different things. A 
formal presentation of a design concept for a potential client will look 
quite different from a sketch of a screen layout intended to explore 
what something will look like. Envisionment is needed to represent 
design work to ourselves and to others. It occurs throughout 
development as the designer generates multiple design solutions and 
whittles them down to a final product or service.

After studying this lecture you should be able to:

* Use a variety of techniques for envisioning design problems and 
possible solutions
* Understand the role of concrete scenarios in envisioning design
* Select and use appropriate prototyping techniques
* Understand the main factors in communicating designs effectively

Envisionment is fundamental to effective human-centred design, to enable designers 
to see things from other people’s perspectives and to explore design concepts and ideas 
with others. Different representations of design ideas are useful at different stages for different people. They help with generation, communication and evaluation of ideas. A sketch ‘on the back of an envelope’ might be useful for generating an idea and expressing it to a colleague – but it is not so good for giving to a client

### An outline envisionment process

Here is a suggested series of steps for the envisionment process, pulling together the 
wide-ranging material in this lecture.

1. Review the design brief, any constraints and requirements and conceptual scenarios. 
2. Develop representations of your design ideas. This is the process of ideation. 
Sketching is central to the process. The aim is to generate many ideas to explore the 
spaces of possible experiences (this lecture). 
3. If your service or product is a new one, experiment with different metaphors and 
design concepts through your representations (in the design part, of the next lecture). 
4. Develop the ‘look and feel’ of the service or product, sketch out the touchpoints, 
channels of interaction and navigational structure of the whole UX (this chapter). 
5. Explore design ideas with the people who will be using the system wherever possible 
(using techniques described in the previous lecture). 
6. Develop wireframes to provide more detail on the proposed structure and navigation 
(this chapter). 
7. Iterate and gradually formalize the design (making it more concrete) through prototypes and further evaluations ( Lecture 7)

### Sketching for ideation

Envisionment is about bringing abstract ideas to life.

Bill Buxton, a UX designer at Microsoft, has promoted the importance of sketching in 
his book Sketching User Experiences

Buxton argues that

* sketches are quick, timely, inexpensive, disposable and plentiful. The UX designer should be happy to throw away sketches and so not get too committed to particular design features. 
Buxton continues by identifying that 
* sketches need a clear vocabulary, have ‘distinct gesture’ (fluidity), minimal detail and an appropriate degree of refinement. 
 Buxton’s final considerations for sketches are that 
* they should suggest and explore rather than confirm and provide some ambiguity. Sketches are there to encourage people to question and to fill in the gaps. The following figure shows an example of a sketch for the interface to an interactive shopping service. Greenberg et al . (2012) emphasize that in addition to the elements shown in the figure, sketches can include annotations, arrows 
(to show movement or to highlight particular areas of the sketch) and notes about issues 
that the designer has yet to resolve.
