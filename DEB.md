# Design and Evaluation of User Interfaces

## Lecture one - Introduction and overview

User Experience (UX) is about designing various types of interactive services and products, including web services, apps, games, and interactive products like home control systems, digital cameras, and tablet applications. It also involves designing entire environments, such as new retail spaces, where various devices and services interact with each other and people. The goal is to enhance the user experience in different settings, including home, work, or community support.

A prime example of an influential interactive product is the iPhone, introduced by Apple Inc. in 2007. The iPhone revolutionized mobile technologies with its carefully crafted interface designed for finger input and a touch-sensitive screen that allowed for multi-touch input. This innovation facilitated new interaction techniques, such as pinching to resize an image. While many devices have since adopted this technology, the iPhone was the pioneer.

User Experience (UX) design encompasses a variety of activities, which can be categorized into product design, system design, and service design depending on the context. The key concerns of a UX designer include:

Design: Understanding what design is and how to implement it effectively.
Technologies: Knowledge about interactive systems, products, devices, and components is crucial.
People: UX designers need to consider the users of the systems and services, aiming to improve their lives through their designs.
Activities and Contexts: UX design is about understanding people’s goals, feelings, and achievements, and considering the contexts within which these activities take place.
In essence, UX design is a holistic (dealing with or treating the whole of something or someone and not just a part) approach that considers the design, technology, people, and the context of use to create a positive user experience.

### Design
*What is design? It’s where you stand with a foot in two worlds – the world of technology and the world of people and human purposes – and you try to bring the two together*
- Mitch Kapor in Winograd (1996), p. 1 

‘Design’ refers to both the creative process of creating something new and the representations produced during this process. Design is not a straightforward process and often involves iteration and exploration of requirements and solutions. The design process evolves with the problem and solution.

Design can be categorized based on the level of formality:

Engineering design is at one end of the spectrum, where scientific principles and technical specifications are used to create formal models before construction begins. ((such as the design of a bridge, a car or a building)

Creative or artistic design is at the other end of the spectrum, emphasizing innovation, imagination, and conceptual ideas. (innovation, imagination and conceptual ideas are the key ingredients.)

Design as craft lies in the middle, incorporating both engineering and creative approaches.

Most design involves aspects of all these categories. For instance, a fashion designer needs to know about people and fabrics, an interior designer needs to know about paints and lighting, and a jewellery designer needs to know about precious stones and metals.

Donald Schön, a famous design commentator, described design as a ‘conversation with materials’, meaning designers must understand the nature of the materials they work with. In the case of UX, the medium consists of interactive systems, services, and the physical spaces where interactions occur. The text also emphasizes that design is a conscious, social activity often undertaken in a design team.

### People and technologies
Interactive systems refer to technologies that UX designers use, which are primarily concerned with interactively processing information content. This includes components, devices, products, services, and software systems that deal with the transmission, display, storage, or transformation of content that people can perceive. These systems respond dynamically to people’s actions.

Examples of interactive systems include mobile phones, websites, delivery tracking systems, and tourist attractions that provide information about specific locations. As connectivity increases, more products are incorporating interactive components, forming device ecologies. This is often referred to as the Internet of Things (IoT).

A key challenge for UX is managing the differences between people and interactive systems. While a machine-centered view sees people as vague and disorganized and machines as precise and orderly, a people-centered view sees people as creative and resourceful and machines as rigid and constrained. UX designers must navigate these differences, often needing to translate people’s goals into instructions that machines can understand.

![Machine- and people-centred views](/imgs/DEB/MachinePeopleCentred.png)

### The interface 
The user interface (UI) of an interactive system is the part of the system that people interact with physically, perceptually, and conceptually.

Physically, interaction might involve pressing buttons or swiping a touch-sensitive screen, with the device providing feedback through tactile responses or display changes.
Perceptually, the device presents visual, auditory, or tactile information that users can perceive.
Conceptually, users interact with the device by understanding its functions and determining their actions accordingly. The device aids this process by providing helpful messages and content.
The UI needs to have mechanisms for both ‘input’ (allowing users to give instructions and enter data) and ‘output’ (providing feedback and displaying content such as information, pictures, movies, animations, etc.). The interface may also facilitate connectivity between devices and services, like the internet.

User Experience (UX) design is not just about creating interfaces. It involves considering the entire human-device ecosystem, including the human-human interactions facilitated by these systems. As interactive systems increasingly consist of interconnected devices - some worn, some embedded in buildings, and some carried - UX designers focus on connecting people through these devices and channels. They need to consider the entire environment they are creating.

### Being human-centred 
User Experience (UX) is about creating interactive experiences with a human-centered approach. This involves prioritizing people’s needs over the capabilities of technology, fostering connections between individuals, including users in the design process, and designing with a focus on diversity. The ultimate goal is to create a user experience that supports and is enjoyable for people.

### The skills of the UX designer
UX designers require a diverse set of skills and understanding across various disciplines. Their key responsibilities include:

Conducting user research to understand people’s activities, goals, and aspirations, and the contexts in which technology might be useful.
Understanding the possibilities offered by technologies.
Creating technological solutions that align with people’s needs, their desired activities, and the contexts of those activities (a process sometimes called ‘ideation’).
Evaluating alternative designs and iterating through further research and design until a solution is found.
Given the breadth of skills and academic disciplines involved, it’s often the case that no single person possesses all the necessary skills for a design activity, making UX design typically a team effort.

A UX designer’s role can vary widely, from designing apps, websites, and promotional materials for a community information system project, to creating a kiosk for processing photographs, developing the information architecture for a real estate firm, or designing a children’s educational game.

While UX designers cannot be experts in all these fields, they need to be sufficiently aware to draw techniques from different areas or access research in different disciplines when appropriate. The subjects that contribute to the design of interactive systems are grouped under the headings of knowledge of people, technologies, activities, contexts, and design, an illustration of this can be seen below:

![Disciplines contributing to interactive systems design](/imgs/DEB/DisciplinesContributingSystemsDesign.png)

### People
In designing user experience, methods from the following disciplines are used to better understand and design for people:
**Sociology:** The study of relationships between people, their groups, and their societal settings.

**Anthropology:** Similar to sociology but also focuses on culture, biology, language, and their evolution. It uses ‘ethnography’ to describe a particular culture or social group.

**Cultural Studies:** Examines people’s relationship with cultural issues like identity and everyday activities like shopping or watching TV.

**Humanistic HCI:** Introduced by Bardzell and Bardzell (2015), it offers a new approach to understanding User Experience (UX).

**Psychology:** Studies how people think, feel, and act. Cognitive psychology focuses on brain functions, language, and problem-solving.

**Ergonomics:** Studies the fit between people and machines.

### Technologies
Interactive system designers need to be proficient in several areas:

**Software:** They should understand software engineering methods for specifying and implementing computer programs. This includes knowledge of programming languages to instruct any programmable device.

**Hardware:** Designers need to be familiar with hardware, specifically sensors for data collection and actuators for effecting change. They should be able to leverage various components to produce different effects, using engineering knowledge and principles.

**Communications:** Understanding of various communication protocols is essential for enabling device intercommunication.

**Content:** Designers should be knowledgeable about multimedia content, including its production and manipulation.

In essence, the design of interactive systems requires a broad and integrated understanding of software, hardware, communications, and content.

### Activities and contexts
Interactions often occur within a ‘community of practice’, a group of individuals with shared interests and activities. In business communities and organizations, methods have been developed to ensure the effectiveness of information systems. The soft systems theory (Checkland and Scholes, 1999) provides a framework for designing interactive systems. Understanding social and organizational psychology is crucial to assess the impact of technological changes on organizations. Recently, knowledge management and social computing have emerged as significant fields. New technologies present fresh opportunities, enabling business and interactive system designers to create innovative ways of working.

### Design
UX design incorporates principles and practices from various design disciplines.
Ideas from architecture, garden design, interior design, fashion, and jewellery design are used in UX design.
Design knowledge is often specific to a genre, making it challenging to simply pick up ideas from different disciplines.
Designers need to understand the materials they work with.
Product design is a key discipline contributing to UX design skills, and it’s evolving to incorporate interactivity.
Graphic design and information design are crucial for information layout, understandability, and the aesthetic experience of products.
Human-computer interaction techniques have evolved to ensure people-focused designs.
UX fits into a range of design disciplines, indicating the diverse skills a UX designer needs to know or access.
Many UX agencies specialize in one or two areas and employ freelance specialists for specific expertise.

### Why being human-centred is important
Human-centred design is costly as it involves observing, communicating, and testing ideas with people.

This approach adds an additional cost to any project.

Businesses often question the worth of investing time in talking to people and producing prototype designs.

Despite the cost, the text asserts that a human-centred approach is fundamentally beneficial.

The human-centred approach is advantageous for designing interactive systems.

### Return on investment 
Williams et al. (2007) conducted case studies on the costs and benefits of a human-centred approach to interactive systems design.

Paying attention to people’s needs, product usability, and overall UX can lead to reduced customer helpline calls, fewer training materials, increased throughput, and increased sales.

Involving people in the design of their systems can ensure acceptability and effectiveness.

Systems designed from a human-centred perspective can increase productivity.

The economic argument is particularly relevant in web design and e-commerce sites.

Jared Spool and User Interface Engineering have demonstrated the importance of good UX to e-commerce.

They claim that sales can increase by 225% by converting ‘browsers’ into ‘buyers’.

### Safety
In the early 1980s, an accident at the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant in the USA nearly caused a meltdown.

One problem was a control panel indicating a valve was closed when it was actually open.

Another issue was an indicator obscured by a tag attached to another control.

These were two fundamental design errors, one technical and one organizational, that could have been avoided with human-centred design techniques.

There have been plane and train disasters attributed to faulty displays or operators not correctly understanding or interpreting displays.

Systems must be designed for people and contexts.

It’s not valid to claim ‘human error’ if the initial design was so poor that an accident was inevitable.

### Ethics
Human-centred design ensures designers are truthful and open in their practice.

With the ease of data collection, designers need to be vigilant about its use.

As systems can connect and share data autonomously, it’s vital for people to know where their data is going and how it might be used.

People need to trust systems and have the ability to make choices about privacy and representation.

Intellectual property is a significant aspect of ethical design.

Issues associated with plagiarism or dishonest use of materials are prevalent.


Privacy, security, control, honesty, equality, and access are significant features of a UX designer’s role.

As technology evolves, so do traditional views and approaches to moral and ethical questions.

Designs need to meet certain standards and legal requirements.

Ethical design is essential as the systems produced should be easy and enjoyable to use, impacting the quality of people’s lives.

Designers have power over others and must exercise that power ethically.

The ACM (Association of Computing Machinery) code of ethics provides guidance on ethical design.

### Sustainability
Interactive systems have a significant impact on the world.

Designers should approach interaction design from a sustainability perspective.

Millions of mobile phones and other devices are discarded each year, containing potentially environmentally harmful metals.

Large displays and projectors consume a lot of power.

Cultures can be overwhelmed by the views and values of dominant hardware and software suppliers.

Local languages can die out when all information is in dominant languages like English, Chinese, or Hindi.

Human-centred design needs to recognize diversity and aim to enhance human values.

## Lecture two - Understanding and Data Collection Techniques
### Aim
This lecture emphasizes the importance of understanding the people, activities, and contexts involved in a design process before starting the creative design. This understanding, termed PACT, helps generate system requirements. However, a thorough understanding of requirements often comes after some design work has been completed and evaluated. The understanding process focuses on what people do, how and why they do it, and any problems with the current system. UX designers aim to develop technologies that enhance efficiency and enjoyment in everyday life. They conduct user research to understand the domain of investigation. This step is known as ‘requirements analysis’ in software engineering or information systems projects. After studying this chapter, one should be able to understand and generate requirements, use techniques for understanding people and their activities, and document the results as requirements on interactive technologies, UX, and services.

### Requirements
The text discusses the role of UX designers in understanding client needs and translating them into product requirements. This process involves studying current activities, gathering user stories, and generating information about the current situation and people’s goals. This information is then transformed into requirements for a new product, system, or service, often requiring a creative leap through a process called ideation.

The process is iterative, with the effectiveness of the designer’s creative leap judged when the user and other designers review the requirements. This is best done with scenarios, early designs, or a prototype. As the design process continues, additional requirements may emerge.

The text also discusses the terminology used for the requirements activity, including ‘requirements gathering’, ‘requirements generation’, ‘requirements elicitation’, and ‘requirements engineering’. The term ‘understanding’ is preferred as it encapsulates the ideas of gathering and generation. Interaction design projects often start from a ‘design brief’, which may be a vague description of what the clients want, and clients often require a requirements specification, a formal written document.

Requirements are divided into two types: functional and non-functional. Functional requirements are what the system must do; non-functional requirements are the qualities that the system must have. These qualities may be crucial factors in the acceptability, sales or usage of a product. Non-functional requirements cover a number of aspects of design, including image and aesthetics, usability, UX, performance, maintainability, security, cultural acceptability and legal restrictions. Also important are the data or media requirements of any system – the type of content that it has to deal with and the various media that will be used.

For both types of requirements, note that how the technology will meet the requirement is not specified. This is a later part of the design activity. It is best to supplement the list of requirements with some supporting evidence – interview or observation reports, photographs of artefacts, video snippets if practicable. This helps readers of the requirements specification understand the reason behind items in the list.

### Prioritizing requirements
Requirements should be reviewed with customers and clients and modified as necessary. Decisions will almost always be made about the relative priority of the requirements, since few design projects have unlimited resources. One way of doing this is by 
using the ‘MoSCoW rules’. These classify requirements into:

* Must have – fundamental requirements without which the system will be unworkable and useless, effectively the minimum usable subset

* Should have – would be essential if more time were available, but the system will be useful and usable without them 

* Could have – of lesser importance, therefore can more easily be left out of the current development

* Want to have but W on’t have this time round – can wait until a later development. 

MoSCoW is an important part of agile development ( Section 3.1 ), with the must-have requirements determining the minimum viable product (MVP) that will be acceptable 
to a particular development.

### Participative design
Research work involves using a variety of techniques to understand and analyze someone else’s needs, goals and aspirations. The key thing for designers to remember is that they 
are not the people who will be using the final system. Designers need to understand the requirements of other people. 
This is not easy, but talking to people through interviews, observing people and recording their activities on video, organizing focus groups and having workshops will all help the designer to understand both the requirements for the new design (the ‘gain’ a new system or service will deliver) and the problems people are having with existing ways of doing things (the ‘pain’ of the current situation). By engaging with people using various techniques that encourage the participation of people in the design process, designers will acquire a large number of stories that form the basis for the analysis work. Recasting several similar stories into more structured conceptual scenarios will also help the designer to understand and generate requirements. 

### Interviews
One of the most effective ways of finding out what people want and what problems they have at the moment is to talk to them! Interviews with all the various stakeholders in the domain are a vital way of gathering stories. Designers employ a range of different styles of interview, from a completely structured survey through to a general conversation. The structured interview uses questions that are developed beforehand. The interview follows the wording exactly. Public opinion polls, for example of the sort produced in great numbers before elections, are normally based on structured interviews. Structured interviews are reasonably easy to carry out, simply because of the degree of pre-structuring. However, people are limited to very restricted replies, and it is difficult for the interviewer to follow up on any unexpected response. Here is an extract from a structured interview pro forma about a student information system.

![Structured Invterview example](imgs/DEB/StructuredInterview.png)

Designers frequently use semi-structured interviews. Sometimes the interviewer is armed with prepared questions but can reword these as appropriate and explore new topics as they arise. Often the interviewer simply prepares a checklist, sometimes with suitable prompts, such as ‘Tell me about the first things you do when you get into the office in the morning’. Clearly, this free-form approach is more demanding for the interviewer, but the data obtained does generally repay the effort. 
The interview is designed to start at a high level, then to probe at a greater level of detail. The analyst’s checklist of topics to cover for this example included the type of information needed, current sources (paper or on-line) and specific examples of information needs. 

Completely unstructured interviews are sometimes used where it is particularly important to minimize designers’ preconceptions, or where very little background information is available beforehand. As the term suggests, there are no pre-set questions or topics beyond the general subject of the project in question. 

###  Stories, scenarios and early prototyping in interviewing 
Scenarios and stories are helpful aids to understanding activities and help avoid having people imagine (or reconstruct) situations in the abstract. For example, people can be 
asked to recall a typical ‘day in the life’ or incidents when the current technology does not support what they need to do. This will identify circumstances that the new design 
must take into account.
Once there is a rough idea of what the new technology might do, discussing a scenario will highlight many issues, from the naming of individual functions to the impact 
of changes in work practice.

Prototypes – anything from paper sketches to semi-functioning products – are very often used to embody scenarios in possible technology. 
For example, in the later stages of analysis for a shared notebook for engineers, simple prototypes created in PowerPoint coupled with small usage scenarios were used. These 
were projected on a screen and discussed in a small group meeting, prompting discussion about the match between our design ideas and the way the engineers currently disseminated information. Whether or not a prototype is used, the analyst and the customer ‘walk through’ the scenario, while the analyst probes for comments, problems, possible alternatives and 
suggestions in general. Depending on the outcome of the scenario/prototype walk-through, modifications and further iterations may be desirable. 

### Think-aloud commentaries
When it is necessary to know a good deal of low-level detail about current technology, users can be asked to talk through the operations concerned – including their internal 
cognitive processes (i.e. what they are thinking about) – as they use the technology in question. This data, properly termed a ‘verbal protocol’ (Ericsson and Simon, 1985), can 
provide helpful indications of current problems. It is important to remember, however, that by imposing the requirement to generate a commentary you are interfering with 
the very process you are attempting to study. Further, not all cognitive processes can be accessed by the conscious mind.

Simply put, have a user test it, and have them say everything they think out loud, in-order to get an insight in what they are thinking, and or trying to do, and therefor potential problems. 

### Questionnaires
Questionnaires are one way of streamlining the understanding process if a large 
number of people are to be surveyed and resources are not available to interview them 
individually. However, constructing a workable questionnaire is surprisingly difficult 
and time-consuming in order to make all the items: 

* understandable 
* unambiguous 
* generate data which actually answers evaluation questions 
* easy to analyze. 

It is a skilled task to devise the wording of questions when there are no opportunities to detect and clear up misunderstandings as they happen. Questionnaires need to be designed, prototyped and evaluated in the same way as any other form of interaction design. For small numbers of people – up to 10 or so – an interview will obtain the same information, and more, in a manageable way. This will consume little or no extra resource if the time required to construct a questionnaire is taken into account. 

### Probes
Probes are collections of artefacts designed to elicit requirements, ideas or opinions in specific contexts. ‘Cultural probes’ were developed by Bill Gaver and colleagues ( Gaver et 
al ., 1999 ) in working with elderly people located in three European cities. The overall aim was to design technologies that would foster greater participation in the community by 
older people. The designers first got to know the groups in person, then introduced them to the cultural probes packages. Each person received a collection of maps, postcards, a 
disposable camera and booklets – each item being carefully designed to stimulate interest and curiosity, and suggesting ways in which people could use it to send ideas back to the designers. They were ‘designed to provoke inspirational responses’ (ibid., p. 22).

The disposable cameras had customized covers which suggested scenes to be captured, such as ‘the first person you will see today’ or ‘something boring’. Over a period of weeks, many of the probe materials were sent back to the designers, carrying rich data about the lives of the elderly people. Not all items worked out as planned – the authors do not specify which – and the materials were selectively redesigned before being distributed to subsequent participants. All in all, the exercise was highly successful in capturing the general sense of what it meant to be elderly in the communities involved, although it is noted that the results did not have a direct impact on design.

Technology probes are another form of probe that were used to gather requirements for home technologies and the area has now evolved into a whole area of ‘probology’. In discussing the use of mobile probes (Hulkko et al., 2004), it is argued that probes are humane, they create fragments of understanding and insight and use uncertainty through providing stories. Probes inspire and provoke designers to engage with the lives of others. 
Another analysis of probes (cultural, mobile, domestic, urban) by Graham et al. (2007) concludes that probes represent the ‘turn to the personal’ in a direct reference to the ‘turn to the social’ that happened in HCI at the beginning of the 1990s. Probes are an amalgam of social science methods for understanding (such as photography, diaries, life documents, etc.) that enables designers to focus upon the individual’s everyday life, going beyond the general.

### Artefact collection and 'desk work'
Data from interviews, questionnaires and observation will have identified a range of artefacts in the form of things that support an activity. It is often possible to supplement this by collecting artefacts – such as documents, forms or spreadsheets, in office settings – or to video or photograph items that cannot be removed. Systems, apps and services that are somehow similar to the domain under investigation should also be studied.

## Lecture three
### Envisionment

Envisionment is concerned with making ideas visible; with externalizing thoughts. Externalization can take all manner of forms: 
stories and scenarios, presentations, sketches, formal models, software prototypes, cardboard models and so on. Different forms of representation will be more or less useful at different stages in the design process and more or less effective for doing different things. A formal presentation of a design concept for a potential client will look 
quite different from a sketch of a screen layout intended to explore what something will look like. Envisionment is needed to represent 
design work to ourselves and to others. It occurs throughout development as the designer generates multiple design solutions and whittles them down to a final product or service.

After studying this lecture you should be able to:

* Use a variety of techniques for envisioning design problems and possible solutions

* Understand the role of concrete scenarios in envisioning design

* Select and use appropriate prototyping techniques

* Understand the main factors in communicating designs effectively

Envisionment is fundamental to effective human-centred design, to enable designers 
to see things from other people’s perspectives and to explore design concepts and ideas 
with others. Different representations of design ideas are useful at different stages for different people. They help with generation, communication and evaluation of ideas. A sketch ‘on the back of an envelope’ might be useful for generating an idea and expressing it to a colleague – but it is not so good for giving to a client

### An outline envisionment process

Here is a suggested series of steps for the envisionment process, pulling together the 
wide-ranging material in this lecture.

1. Review the design brief, any constraints and requirements and conceptual scenarios. 
2. Develop representations of your design ideas. This is the process of ideation. 
Sketching is central to the process. The aim is to generate many ideas to explore the 
spaces of possible experiences (this lecture). 
3. If your service or product is a new one, experiment with different metaphors and 
design concepts through your representations (in the design part, of the next lecture). 
4. Develop the ‘look and feel’ of the service or product, sketch out the touchpoints, 
channels of interaction and navigational structure of the whole UX (this chapter). 
5. Explore design ideas with the people who will be using the system wherever possible 
(using techniques described in the previous lecture). 
6. Develop wireframes to provide more detail on the proposed structure and navigation 
(this chapter). 
7. Iterate and gradually formalize the design (making it more concrete) through prototypes and further evaluations ( Lecture 7)

### Sketching for ideation

Envisionment is about bringing abstract ideas to life.

Bill Buxton, a UX designer at Microsoft, has promoted the importance of sketching in 
his book Sketching User Experiences

Buxton argues that

* sketches are quick, timely, inexpensive, disposable and plentiful. The UX designer should be happy to throw away sketches and so not get too committed to particular design features. 
Buxton continues by identifying that 
* sketches need a clear vocabulary, have ‘distinct gesture’ (fluidity), minimal detail and an appropriate degree of refinement. 
 Buxton’s final considerations for sketches are that 
* they should suggest and explore rather than confirm and provide some ambiguity. Sketches are there to encourage people to question and to fill in the gaps. The following figure shows an example of a sketch for the interface to an interactive shopping service. Greenberg et al . (2012) emphasize that in addition to the elements shown in the figure, sketches can include annotations, arrows 
(to show movement or to highlight particular areas of the sketch) and notes about issues 
that the designer has yet to resolve.

![Interface Sketch](imgs/DEB/InterfaceSketch.png)

Storyboarding is a technique taken from filmmaking – using a simple cartoon-like structure, key moments from the interactive experience are represented. The advantage of storyboarding is that it allows you to get a feel for the ‘flow’ of an experience. It is also a very economical way of representing the design – a single page can hold 6–8 ‘scenes’. It is often helpful to sketch out a storyboard based around a concrete scenario. The two together are very helpful in working through design ideas with customers.

Three main types of storyboarding are commonly found in UX design:

* Traditional storyboarding. A storyboard for a film would usually have some notes 
attached to each scene expanding on what will happen – this helps overcome the 
limitations of representing a dynamic experience in a static medium. In UX design, 
notes below each sketch usually contain the relevant steps from a scenario, and the 
sketches themselves. 
* Scored storyboards. If the application has a lot of motion graphics the storyboard can 
be annotated – a sketch is annotated with appropriate notation and notes about, for 
example, type, colours, images, sound and other issues are attached underneath. 
* Text-only storyboards. These are useful if the application has a lot of complex 
sequences. You can specify what images appear, what text accompanies them, any 
accompanying media, general notes about tone, flow, etc.

### Visualizing look and feel

Designers need ways to envision the various touchpoints, service moments and user journeys so that they can establish a common ‘look and feel’ for the whole UX. The look (how things are represented) and feel (how things behave) should have some consistency across the different channels and should reflect the overall brand that the UX is aiming to establish

Designers should aim to evoke particular meanings in their users. They should aim to bring about those key aspects of experience design – identity, adaptivity, narrative, immersion and flow – along with the characteristics of evoking the different 
types of pleasure and characteristics of product attachment. Designers need to establish the aesthetics of the product or service they are developing. To do this, designers need to find some way to envision the feelings and sense of 
presence that users will have when they experience a service or product.

### Mood boards

Mood boards are widely used in advertising and interior design. Quite simply design ers gather visual stimuli that capture something of the feeling about the design. Photographs and other images, colours, textures, shapes, headlines from newspapers or magazines, quotations from people, pieces of fabric can all be used to contribute to this.

Lucero (2012) argues that mood boards are useful for ‘framing, aligning, paradoxing, abstracting, and directing’ designers in their work on the look and feel of a product or service.

The rule with mood boards is that ‘anything goes’. The point of the board is not to 
formally represent some aspect of the design but simply to act as inspiration – perhaps 
promoting a particular line of thought, or providing inspiration for a colour scheme. 
One technique is to get the client to create a mood board. This can give you an insight 
into the kinds of aesthetics that are likely to appeal to them.

### Descriptive adjectives

As a variation on the mood board concept, writing down adjectives that describe some aspect of the system can be useful. You can envision the look of a service by writing down what emotions you want it to evoke in the users. For example, you want users to feel that this is a serious app, providing content that has been well researched and well written but that retains some sense of adventure and intrigue. Listing descriptive adjectives for a project will lead to a set of semantic scales that subsequently can be used for evaluation through semantic differentials.

## Lecture Four - Physical Design - General guidelines and widgets

### SUS  - A quick and dirty usability scale

The System Usability Scale (SUS) is a simple, ten-item scale giving a global view of subjective assessments of usability. <br>
SUS is a Likert scale . It is often assumed that a Likert scale is simply one based on 
forced-choice questions, where a statement is made and the respondent then indicates 
the degree of agreement or disagreement with the statement on a 5 (or 7) point scale.

####  Using SUS

The SU scale is generally used after the respondent has had an opportunity to use the 
system being evaluated, but before any debriefing or discussion takes place. 
Respondents should be asked to record their immediate response to each item, rather 
than thinking about items for a long time. <br>
All items should be checked. If a respondent feels that they cannot respond to a 
particular item, they should mark the centre point of the scale.

#### Scoring SUS

SUS yields a single number representing a composite measure of the overall usability 
of the system being studied. Note that scores for individual items are not meaningful 
on their own. 
To calculate the SUS score, first sum the score contributions from each item. Each 
item’s score contribution will range from 0 to 4. For items 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9 the score 
contribution is the scale position minus 1. For items 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10, the contribution

### Principles

For ease of memorizing and use we have grouped them into three main categories – 
learnability, effectiveness and accommodation – but these groupings are not rigid. 
Systems should be learnable, effective and accommodating.

Principles 1–4 are concerned with access, ease of learning and remembering (learnability). <br>
Principles 5–7 are concerned with ease of use, and principles 8 and 9 with safety (effectiveness). <br>
Principles 10–12 are concerned with accommodating differences between people and respecting those differences (accommodation).<br>
Designing user experience from a human-centred perspective is concerned with the following.

Helping people access, learn and remember the system

1 *Visibility*. Try to ensure that things are visible so that people can see what functions are available and what the system is currently doing. This is an important part of the psychological principle that it is easier to recognize things than to have to recall them. If it is not possible to make it visible, make it observable. Consider making things ‘visible’ through the use of sound and touch. <br>
2 *Consistency*. Be consistent in the use of language and design features and be consistent with similar systems and standard ways of working. Consistency can be something of a slippery concept (see the Further thoughts box). Both conceptual and physical consistency are important.<br>
3 *Familiarity*. Use language and symbols that the intended audience will be familiar with. Where this is not possible because the concepts are quite different from those people know about, provide a suitable metaphor to help them transfer similar and related knowledge from a more familiar domain.<br>
4 *Affordance*. Design things so it is clear what they are for – for example, make buttons look like push buttons so people will press them. Affordance refers to the properties that things have (or are perceived to have) and how these relate to how the things could be used. Buttons afford pressing, chairs afford sitting on, and Post-it Notes afford writing a message on and sticking next to something else. Affordances are culturally determined.<br>

*Giving them the sense of being in control, knowing what to do and how to do it*<br>
5 *Navigation*. Provide support to enable people to move around the parts of the system: maps directional signs and information signs.<br>
6 *Control*. Make it clear who or what is in control and allow people to take control. Control is enhanced if there is a clear, logical mapping between controls and the effect that they have. Also make clear the relationship between what the system does and what will happen in the world outside the system.<br>
7 *Feedback*. Rapidly feed back information from the system to people so that they 
know what effect their actions have had. Constant and consistent feedback will 
enhance the feeling of control.<br><br>
*Safely and securely*<br>
8 *Recovery*. Enable recovery from actions, particularly mistakes and errors, quickly and effectively.<br>
9 *Constraints*. Provide constraints so that people do not try to do things that are inappropriate. In particular, people should be prevented from making serious errors through properly constraining allowable actions and seeking confirmation of dangerous operations.<br>

*In a way that suits them*<br>
10 *Flexibility*. Allow multiple ways of doing things so as to accommodate people with different levels of experience and interest in the system. Provide people with the opportunity to change the way things look or behave so that they can personalize the system.<br>
11 *Style*. Designs should be stylish and attractive.<br>
12 *Conviviality*. Interactive systems should be polite, friendly and generally pleasant. Nothing ruins the experience of using an interactive system more than an aggressive message or an abrupt interruption. Design for politeness
Conviviality also suggests joining in and using interactive technologies to connect 
and support people.

### Dark Patterns

Besides these guidelines for developing good designs, we should acknowledge that 
there are interaction patterns aimed at duping users, or aimed at getting them to do 
things that they did not intend to do. These so-called dark patterns aim to get users to 
sign up to full-price services, post items on their social media, frighten users into making some choice or do a host of other things. There is a comprehensive list at [www.darkpatterns.org](www.darkpatterns.org)

### Summary

Good design is about usability. It is about ensuring that systems are accessible to all and 
that designs are acceptable for the people and contexts in which they will be used. 
Designers need to evaluate their designs with people and involve people in the design 
process. Paying attention to design principles can help sensitize the designer to key 
aspects of good design.

* Access to interactive systems for all people is an important right. 
* Usability is concerned with balancing the PACT elements in a domain. 
* Acceptability is concerned with ensuring that designs are appropriate to contexts of use. 
* Twelve design principles are particularly important. They can be grouped into three 
main design issues of learnability, effectiveness and accommodation.

## Lecture Five - Physical Design - Memory and Attention

### Memory
Memory is usually divided into a set of memory processes and a number of different types of memory store. The table below is a summary of the main memory stores and their sub-components and associated processes. The figure is an illustration of this multistore model of memory (note the role of attention).
![A summary of the structure of memory ](imgs/DEB/StructureOfMemory.png)

#### Memory stores: working memory
Working memory, first identified and named by Baddeley and Hitch (1974), is made up from three linked components: a central executive, a visuospatial sketchpad and an articulatory loop (also called the phonological loop). The central executive is involved in decision making, planning and related activities. It is also closely linked to managing our ability to perform more than one thing at a time (see the section below which discusses the role of attention). The articulatory or phonological loop can be thought of as behaving like a loop of audio tape. When we are trying to call an unfamiliar telephone number or repeating a phrase in a foreign language, we tend to repeat the string of numbers (or words) either out loud or silently to ourselves. This process is called rehearsal. When we are doing this we are making use of the articulatory loop, which can also account for our experience of the inner voice. The analogy of the audio tape is useful as it allows us to see that the articulatory loop is limited in both capacity and duration.

The visuo-spatial sketchpad (also called the scratchpad) is the visual and spatial information equivalent of the articulatory loop and has been linked to our mind’s eye.We use our mind’s eye to visualize a route through a town or building or for the mental rotation of figures (visualize a coin and then rotate it to see what is on the other side). The visuo-spatial sketchpad is also limited in capacity and duration unless refreshed by means of rehearsal. Finally, the capacity of working memory itself is approximately three or four items (e.g. MacGregor, 1987; LeCompte, 1999) where an item may be a word or a phrase or an image. It should be noted that older textbooks and papers suggest that the limit of short-term memory is 7 ± 2 items, sometimes called the magical number 7: this is now known to be incorrect. 

#### Memory stores: long-term memory 
Long-term memory has an effectively unlimited capacity and memories stored there may last as long as an individual’s lifetime. The coding (the internal representation) of 
the information it holds is primarily semantic in nature, that is, it is stored in terms of its meaning, for example knowledge of facts and the meaning of words (contrast this with 
the binary encoding of information in a computer). However, research has indicated that other forms of encoding are present too – for example, memories of music or the 
bark of a dog are encoded as auditory information; similarly, haptic (touch) encoding allows us to remember the feeling of silk and the sting of a cut. Finally, olfactory (smell) 
and gustatory (taste) encoding allow us to recognize and distinguish between the smell and taste of fresh and rotten food. 

In addition to semantic memory, long-term memory includes other kinds of memories such as episodic or autobiographical memory (memory of our personal history, 
for example our first kiss, graduation day, the death of a parent) and procedural memory (e.g. the knowledge of how to ride a bike, type, play the euphonium). This neat three-way division of long-term memory into component parts – semantic, episodic and procedural – has been questioned by Cohen and Squire (1980), who argue that the real distinction is between ‘knowing that’ (declarative memory) and ‘knowing how’ (procedural memory), but in practice there is little between these two accounts. 

#### How do we remember? 
If what we want to store is not too complex (that is, it does not exceed the capacity of working memory), we will typically rehearse it, that is, repeat the string of words 
either aloud or using our inner voice. This is useful for remembering unfamiliar names or strings of numbers or words such as a foreign phrase, for example ‘Dos cervezas, por favor’. This technique exploits the articulatory loop of working memory. Similar strategies are used to remember, for a short time, the shape of an object or a set of directions. The capacity of working memory can effectively be enhanced by chunking the material to be remembered first. Chunking is the process by which we can organize material into meaningful groups (chunks). For example, an apparently random string of numbers such as 00441314551234 may defeat most people unless it is chunked. This particular number may be seen to be a telephone number made up from the code for international calls (0044), the area code for Edinburgh (131) and the prefix for Edinburgh Napier University (455), leaving only 1234 to remember. Thus the string of numbers has been reduced to four chunks. 

So how do we remember things for longer periods? One answer is elaboration, which has been developed as an alternative view of memory in itself. The levels of processing (LoP) model proposed by Craik and Lockhart (1972) argues that rather than focusing on the structural, multi-store model of memory we should emphasize the memory processes involved. The LoP model recognizes that any given stimulus (piece of information) can be processed in a number of ways (or levels), ranging from the trivial or shallow all the way through to a deep, semantic analysis. Superficial processing may involve the analysis of the stimulus’s surface features such as its colour or shape; a deeper level of analysis may follow which may test for such things as whether the stimulus (e.g. cow) rhymes with the word ‘hat’. The final and deepest level of analysis is the semantic, which considers the stimulus’s meaning – does the word refer to a mammal? 
Finally, we are able to retrieve stored information by way of recall and/or recognition. Recall is the process whereby individuals actively search their memories to retrieve a particular piece of information. Recognition involves searching our memory and then deciding whether the piece of information matches what we have in our memory stores. 

#### How and why do we forget? 
There are numerous theories of forgetting. However, before we discuss their strengths and weaknesses, we begin with another key distinction, namely the difference between 
accessibility and availability . Accessibility refers to whether or not we are able to retrieve information that has been stored in memory, while the availability of a memory depends on whether or not it was stored in memory. The metaphor of a library is often used to illustrate this difference. Imagine you are trying to find a specific book in a library. There are three possible outcomes: 
1. You find the book (the memory is retrieved). 
2. The book is not in the library (the memory is not available). 
3. The book is in the library but has been misfiled (not accessible). 

There is, of course, a fourth possibility, namely that someone else has borrowed the 
book, which is where the metaphor breaks down
As we described earlier, information is transferred from working memory to long-term memory to be stored permanently, which means that availability is the main issue for working memory while accessibility is the main (potential) problem for long-term memory.
