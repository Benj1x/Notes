        Complete the second statement using the ternary operator (? :) and the bitwise
        AND operator (&) that will make a message "x is odd". Your code must contain
        the following tokens in any order: x, &,==, ?, :, "odd", and "even". You may use
        additional tokens as needed:
        int x = 19;
        String msg = your-code-goes-here ;
        System.out.println("x is " + msg)*/
