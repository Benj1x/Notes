# Systems Development/System Analysis and Design

## Lecture one

### FACTOR

The factor criterion consists of six elements: <br>
Functionality: The system functions that support the application-do-main tasks.<br><br>
Application domain: Those parts of an organization that administrate, monitor, or control a problem domain. <br><br>
Conditions: The conditions under which the system will be developed and used. <br><br>
Technology: Both the technology used to develop the system and the technology on which the system will run.<br><br>
Objects: The main onbjets in the problem domain. <br><br>
Responsibility: The system's overall responsibility in relation to its context.

The FACTOR criterion can be used in two ways. You can use it to support system-definition development, carefully considering how each of the six elements should be formulated.  Or you can start your definition by describing the system and then use the criteria to see how the system definition satisfies each of the six factors. "In principle either starting point works"
